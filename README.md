- 👋 Hi, I’m @Parrotsheet123
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in python and c. I'm currently specialising in 2d graphical games. But I'm planning to possibly make some 3d games in the future. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python gui/ui, and c game development, (though I am currently using Pythons pygame module, I will be converting my games to c relatively
soon). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: possibly my top down, rpg game. 
- 📫 How to reach me: ibraheem.khan2004@gmail.com
